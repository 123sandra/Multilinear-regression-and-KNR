# Multilinear-regression-and-KNR
Developed a model for prediction using Multiple Linear Regressiona and find the performance measure and also created KNeighbor Regression and trained the model and predicted with new value and also find the Performance Measure.
# Conclusion
When I created a model using Multiple Linear Regression, I achieved an R² score of 90.71%, but when I trained the model using K-Neighbors Regression, the R² score improved to 93.42%, indicating a better fit with the KNN model.
